## Introduction
To use our stylesheet this HTML structure is required.
You can get this by pressing `!`
![html](htmlL.svg)

After this assign the css file by putting the following code inside your `<head> </head>` tag.
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://hirujaedurapola.github.io/SJML/sjml.css">
```

## Hello World!

All of us have said Hello World! at least in one programming language right? 
But has never been this easier.

Just add the following line of code.
```html
<hello></hello>
```
